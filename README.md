# Reflections/Venting

Chess was my first complex project and was a great way to push my boundaries and level up as a programmer. I'm proud of it as my first serious attempt at a larger program with multiple files and many working parts. Looking back on it, I do see a lot of room for improvement. My gameplay loop is cluttered with too many methods being called, and my testing needs a second look to reduce redundancy. Further, the AI is very simple and I can see ways to make it stronger in various ways. Building it was fun and I'm glad I pushed through it to produce something complete, nevertheless.
